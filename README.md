## Introduction
Welcome to my Image Repository Challenge repository! Hope all is well :) 

*Project was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, and Simple React Lightbox*

## What is the goal of this project?
This project was built for Shopify's Developer Intern Challenge, Winter 2022. I wanted to challenge myself and build the Image Repository using ReactJS as I picked it up over this summer. I would like to mention that the main highlight/feature for this build was the SEARCH functionality. 

Side note: For practice on ReactJS, I had built 2 projects, "[share-note](https://github.com/barathvelmu/share-note)" and "[remind-me](https://github.com/barathvelmu/remind-me)", which are both available on my GitHub page for reference. 

This project was my first time writing unit tests in ReactJS as well! Therefore, lots of learning! Definitely so much more different from Spring's testing framework! 

Features of my Image Repository (please view project demo): 
- image tagging ability
- image segration based on tags: All, Earth, Water, Building 
- **search functionality** by image name and image tag (searchbar)
- lightbox effect with zoom in functionality
- image download functionality

## How do I use this project?:
It's actually very simple! The repository features 16/32 pictures and defaults the "All" tag page as the homepage. There exists a searchbar at the top left where the user can either search by a specific image name or image tag. For the purpose of the project, the image names are "imgX" where X = 1, 2, ..., 16. 

Last but not least, the user is given the ability to switch between the tags on the navbar above. As introduced in the section above, the tags are "All, Earth, Water, Building". This will filter the pictures for the respective tag requested by the user. 

For more information, please view the project demo linked at the end of the README page. Thank you! 

## Future Improvements:
- Dynamic search, images accordingly vanish/appear according to user actions  
- Search by image characteristics (not limited to 1)
- Some overlay effect on image grid (e.g., with name)
- Ability to import or ADD images.
- Ability to remove or DELETE images.
