# Winter 2022 - Shopify Developer Intern Challenge
## Image Repository

## Introduction
Welcome to my Image Repository Challenge repository! Hope all is well :) 

*Project was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, and Simple React Lightbox*

## What is the goal of this project?
This project was built for Shopify's Developer Intern Challenge, Winter 2022. I wanted to challenge myself and build the Image Repository using ReactJS as I picked it up over this summer. I also built 2 projects, "[share-note](https://github.com/barathvelmu/share-note)" and "[remind-me](https://github.com/barathvelmu/remind-me)", available on my GitHub page for reference. I would like to mention that the main highlight/feature for this build was the SEARCH functionality. 

This project was my first time writing unit tests for React as well! Lots of learning! Super happy I got the opportuninty to work with it! Definitely so much more different from Spring's testing framework! 

Features of my Image Repository: 
- image tagging ability
- image segration based on tags: All, Earth, Water, Building 
- **search functionality** by image name and image tag (searchbar)
- lightbox effect with zoom in functionality
- image download functionality

## Future Improvements:
- Dynamic search, images accordingly vanish/appear according to user actions  
- Search by image characteristics (not limited to 1)
- Overlay effect on image grid (with name showing)
- Ability to import or ADD images.
- Ability to remove or DELETE images.
